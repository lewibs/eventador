# eventador
This package is used to give eventListeners more robust options while maintaining backwards compatibility. Meaning your program can have this added in and it will run smoothly. On top of that it makes removing eventListeners much easier because of guids assigned to each event. :) <br/>

# usage
To use eventador in a project you are able to install using:
```js
  npm install eventador
```
